# NFC Hackathon

This initial prototype follows a monolithic structure.

## Setup Guide

1. Add backend base url to frontend/.env.local and frontend base url to backend/.env

2. Run main.py in backend/src

3. Start frontend server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Source ingestion

Data is taken from publicly available APIs and scraped from reputable
financial news websites. Future work can include premium APIs such as BLPAPI
(Bloomberg API). For demonstration purposes, only free sources are used.

### APIs

Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

- US macro and regional economic time series
- Annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily

```python
# Return all available macroeconomic indicator categories.
def list_fred_categories() -> List[str]:

# Return all macroeconomic indicators for category.
def list_fred_indicators(category: str) -> Dict[str, str]:

# Fetch data for a macroeconomic indicator from FRED.
def get_fred_indicator_data(
    indicator_name: str,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    start_date: Optional[str] = None,
    end_date: Optional[str] = None,
    sort_order: str = "asc",
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
) -> Dict:

# Fetch data for all macroeconomic indicators in a category from FRED.
def get_fred_category_data(
    category: str,
    start_date: Optional[str] = None,
    end_date: Optional[str] = None,
    sort_order: str = "asc",
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
) -> Dict[str, Dict]:
```

GDELT-based webcrawler

Major news sites block webcrawlers unless users pay a subscription fee or
license. The GDELT endpoint offers keyword-based search to find news articles,
which our webcrawler then scrapes.

```python
# Run the GDELT spider to crawl and scrape news articles.
def run_gdelt_spider(
    query_terms: str | List[str],
    timespan: str,
    maxrecords: int,
    debug: Optional[bool] = False,
) -> None:
```

News article output format.

```json
{
    "title": "Title",
    "language": "English",
    "sourcecountry": "USA",
    "source": "USA News",
    "url": "www.news.com",
    "published_at": "2025-01-01",
    "author": "John USA",
    "raw": "...",
    "tone": "Positive",
    "fetch_error": null
}
```

## Modules

### `pipeline.py`
Main entry point. Reads raw article JSON, runs all enrichment steps, and outputs records matching the unified event schema.

**Input**
```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "text": "...",
  "source": "finance.yahoo.com",
  "sourcecountry": "United States",
  "published_at": "2026-03-04T15:55:12.000Z",
  "url": "https://...",
  "fetch_error": null
}
```

**Output**
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "event_type": "news",
  "source": "finance.yahoo.com",
  "published_at": "2026-03-04T15:55:12.000Z",
  "region": "US",
  "asset_classes": ["equities", "commodities"],
  "content": "cleaned article text",
  "importance_score": 0.61,
  "entities": { "tickers": ["USB", "SPY"], "countries": ["United States"] },
  "topic": null,
  "sentiment": "risk-off",
  "raw_payload_ref": "raw/https://...",
  "created_at": "2026-03-06T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Usage**
```bash
python pipeline.py
# reads articles.json → writes output.json + skipped.json
```

Articles with `fetch_error` are skipped and written to `skipped.json`. Articles with content shorter than 150 characters or flagged as scrape failures are processed with null NLP fields.

---

### `processors/extractor.py`
Extracts tickers and countries from article text.

- **Tickers** — regex match (`[A-Z]{3,5}`) against a reference set loaded from `ticker_loader.py`. Two-letter tickers on a whitelist (`GE`, `GS`, `MS`, `BA` etc.) are also included.
- **Countries** — spaCy `en_core_web_trf` GPE entity label, filtered against a known country list to exclude cities, regions, and industrial sites.

```python
from processors.extractor import extract_entities

extract_entities("U.S. Bancorp (USB) outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY)...")
# → {"tickers": ["SPY", "USB"], "countries": ["United States"]}
```

---

### `processors/ticker_loader.py`
Fetches the ticker reference set from Wikipedia (S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, Dow Jones) and caches it locally to `ticker_cache.json`.

- First run fetches ~600 tickers from Wikipedia and writes the cache
- Subsequent runs load from cache instantly
- Falls back to a hardcoded set if network is unavailable

```python
from processors.ticker_loader import TICKER_SET, refresh

# Force a fresh fetch and overwrite cache
refresh()
```

Delete `ticker_cache.json` to trigger a refresh on the next run.

---

### `processors/importance.py`
Scores each article's market importance on a 0.0 – 1.0 scale using three signals:

| Signal | Weight | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Source tier | 50% | Known sources rated 0.3 – 1.0 (Reuters/Bloomberg = 1.0, Yahoo Finance = 0.5) |
| Entities | 30% | Number of tickers and countries mentioned |
| Recency | 20% | Linear decay from 1.0 → 0.0 over 24 hours |

```python
from processors.importance import score_importance

score_importance(
    source       = "reuters.com",
    entities     = {"tickers": ["SPY", "TLT"], "countries": ["US", "China"]},
    published_at = "2026-03-06T10:00:00.000Z"
)
# → 0.87
```

---

### `processors/sentiments.py`
Classifies article text as `risk-on`, `risk-off`, or `neutral` using [ProsusAI/FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert), a BERT model fine-tuned on financial news.

FinBERT's native labels (`positive`, `negative`, `neutral`) are remapped to risk appetite language:

| FinBERT | Output |
|---|---|
| positive | risk-on |
| negative | risk-off |
| neutral | neutral |

```python
from processors.sentiments import predict_one, predict_scalar

predict_one("Apple beats earnings expectations by 20%")
# → "risk-on"

predict_scalar(["Fed signals rate hikes", "Markets steady"], batch_size=32)
# → ["risk-off", "neutral"]
```

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Known Limitations

- **Country extraction** tags cities and regions as countries if not filtered — articles with heavy geopolitical content may over-report country counts
- **Ticker extraction** misses companies referenced by full name only (e.g. "U.S. Bancorp" without the `USB` symbol)
- **FinBERT** was trained on short financial headlines — sentiment reliability degrades on long-form articles (>512 tokens are truncated)
- **`published_at`** is null for a significant portion of ingested articles, defaulting recency score to 0.5
- **`topic`** field is reserved for a future classifier and is always `null`
## Analysis layer

### Overview
`analysislib` is the analysis pipeline for turning enriched events into:
- grouped macro themes,
- theme heat scores (0-100),
- market impact summaries,
- optional portfolio risk alerts.

Unlike the older draft, this layer is now wired for DB sync via `sync_themes.py`, and has a single public entrypoint for other teams: `run_analysis(...)`.

### Current folder structure

```text
backend/src/analysislib/
|-- __init__.py              
|-- run_analysis.py          # entrypoint
|-- sync_themes.py           # recompute + upsert theme heat into DB
|-- test.py                  # fake-data seed script for frontend testing
|-- test_connection.py       # DB connectivity smoke test
|-- logic/
    |-- macro_themes.py
    |-- heat_score.py
    |-- market_impact.py
    |-- portfolio_analysis.py
```

### Entrypoint contract (`run_analysis`)

Input:
- `events: list[dict]` (required)
- `user_id: str | None` (optional)
- `portfolio: list[dict] | None` (optional)

Minimal event fields expected:
- `topic` (str)
- `asset_classes` (list[str])
- `importance_score` (number)
- `sentiment` (`risk-on` | `risk-off` | `neutral`)
- `published_at` (ISO datetime string)
- `region` (optional)

Output:
- `themes`
- `market_impacts`
- `portfolio_risk` (or `None` if no portfolio input)
- `summary` (`events_input`, `themes_count`, `impacts_count`, `alerts_count`)

Example usage:

```python
from backend.src.analysislib import run_analysis

result = run_analysis(events=my_events, user_id="user-123", portfolio=my_portfolio)
print(result["summary"])
```

### Pipeline flow

1. Group events into themes (`logic/macro_themes.py`)
2. Score heat per theme (`logic/heat_score.py`)
3. Generate market impact (`logic/market_impact.py`)
4. Optionally evaluate portfolio risk (`logic/portfolio_analysis.py`)

### DB sync and frontend seeding

- `sync_themes.py` is the production-facing bridge to store active themes and heat scores in the `themes` table.
- `test.py` seeds fake data through `run_analysis(...)` and upserts into `themes` for frontend testing.

Run seed script:

```bash
python -m backend.src.analysislib.test
```

### MVP status (analysis scope)

Implemented:
- End-to-end analysis flow behind one entrypoint.
- Theme heat retrieval path for frontend (`/api/themes/hottest`).
- Fake-data seeding workflow for demo/testing.

Still placeholder by design:
- Rule-based theme grouping/scoring heuristics (not LLM-driven yet).
- Portfolio input is only as accurate as provided upstream portfolio data.
- Advanced explanation/recommendation generation is not in this layer yet.

## Storage

### Overview

The storage layer is split into three components, each serving a distinct
purpose:

| Store | Technology | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw store | Supabase Storage | Immutable original payloads |
| Processed store | Supabase Postgres | Cleaned, query-ready structured data |
| Memory store | Supabase pgvector | Semantic retrieval over unstructured text |

---

## Processed Store Tables

### `events`

Normalized event records. The central table everything else references.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| event_id | uuid | Primary key, generated before DB insert |
| event_type | text | e.g. economic_release, news |
| source | text | Publisher name |
| published_at | timestamptz | Original publication time |
| region | text | e.g. US, EU |
| asset_classes | text[] | e.g. [bonds, equities] |
| content | text | Cleaned article text |
| importance_score | float | 0-1 |
| entities | dict | e.g. {"countries": ["US", "China"], "tickers": ["SPY", "TLT"]} |
| topic | text | e.g. inflation, rates, geopolitics |
| sentiment | text | risk-on, risk-off, neutral |
| raw_payload_ref | text | Path to raw file in Supabase Storage |
| created_at | timestamptz | row creation time |

### `themes`

Grouped clusters of related events identified by the analysis agent.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| theme_id | uuid | Primary key |
| title | text | Human-readable theme name |
| description | text | Description of theme |
| status | text | active, cooling, inactive |
| heat_score | float | How active/relevant the theme is |
| first_seen_at | timestamptz | When theme was first detected |
| last_seen_at | timestamptz | When theme last had new events |
| region | text | e.g. US, EU |
| asset_classes | text[] | e.g. [bonds, equities] |
| created_at | timestamptz | row creation time |

### `raw_ingestions`

Info on articles that have been ingested to storage. Contains both processed and unprocessed articles.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| storage_path | text | Storage path of article in Supabase Storage |
| source | text | Source of article |
| ingested_at | timestamptz | When article was ingested |
| processed | bool | Whether article is processed or not |
| processed_at | timestamptz | When article was processed |
| event_id | uuid | Foreign key to events table |

### `event_theme_map`

Many-to-many link between events and themes. One event can belong to multiple
themes.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| event_id | uuid | Foreign key to events |
| theme_id | uuid | Foreign key to events |
| created_at | timestamptz | Time row was created |

### `portfolio_exposure`

Per-user portfolio holdings. Used to match themes to user risk.

### `risk_alerts`

Generated alerts when a theme breaches a severity threshold for a user.

### `recommendations`

Suggested actions with confidence score and a reference to the AI's reasoning
in the memory store.

---

## Raw Store

Original payloads are stored in Supabase Storage under the `raw-payloads`
bucket.

Storage path format: `{event_id}.json`

The `raw_payload_ref` field on each event row points to this path. To retrieve
the full article:

```text
memory.metadata.event_id -> events.raw_payload_ref -> Supabase Storage
```

---

## Memory Store

The memory store enables semantic retrieval - finding relevant past context by
meaning, not keywords.

### What gets stored

| content_type | When | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| article_chunk | After enrichment | Chunked article text (~500 words) |
| summary | After analysis | AI-generated theme or event summary |
| recommendation_rationale | After recommendation generated | AI reasoning |
| timeline_note | During theme lifecycle | Notes on theme evolution |

### How retrieval works

```text
User query
    ->
embed_query(query)          <- uses RETRIEVAL_QUERY task type
    ->
match_memory(embedding)     <- nearest-neighbor search in pgvector
    ->
top-k results ranked by cosine similarity
    ->
filter by metadata (date, region, content_type)
```

### Task types

Always use the correct task type when embedding:

- `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` - when inserting into memory
- `RETRIEVAL_QUERY` - when searching memory

Using mismatched types degrades retrieval quality.

## Storage API

All database interactions go through `db.py`.

### Events

```python
# Insert a new event
insert_event(event: Event) -> JsonDict

# Get events with optional filters
get_events(
    topic: str | None,
    region: str | None,
    min_importance: float | None,
    days: int | None,
) -> list[JsonDict]
```

### Themes

```python
# Insert a new theme
insert_theme(theme: Theme) -> JsonDict

# Get all active themes
get_active_themes(min_heat: float | None) -> list[JsonDict]

# Get a theme by id
get_theme_by_id(theme_id: str) -> JsonDict | None

# Update a theme (e.g. heat_score, status)
update_theme(theme_id: str, updates: JsonDict) -> JsonDict
```

### Event-Theme Map

```python
# Link an event to a theme
link_event_to_theme(event_id: str, theme_id: str) -> JsonDict

# Get all events for a theme
get_events_for_theme(theme_id: str) -> list[JsonDict]
```

### Memory Store

```python
# Insert into memory store
insert_memory(content: str, embedding: list[float], content_type: str, metadata: JsonDict
) -> JsonDict

# Search from memory store (top-k)
search_memory(
    embedding: list[float], top_k: int = 5, content_type: str | None = None
) -> list[JsonDict]
```

### Storage
```python
# Ingest raw article to storage
ingest_raw_article(raw_payload: str, source: str) -> JsonDict

# Get all unprocessed articles and returns rows from raw_ingestions table
# Example usage below
get_unprocessed() -> list[JsonDict]

# Mark article as processed
mark_processed(ingestion_id: str, event_id: str) -> None

# Get article from storage
get_full_article(event_id: str) -> JsonDict | None
```

## Example Usage

```python
import json

# mock payload
source = "reuters"
raw_payload = json.dumps(
    {
        "source": source,
        "published_at": "2026-03-04T10:00:00Z",
        "title": "US Inflation Surges to 4.2%",
        "full_text": (
            "US inflation rose to 4.2% in March, exceeding expectations of 3.8%. "
            "The Federal Reserve is expected to respond with further rate hikes."
        ),
        "url": "https://reuters.com/example",
    }
)

# ingests article to storage
# also adds a row to raw_ingestions
ingest = ingest_raw_article(raw_payload, source)

# gets all unprocessed articles from table raw_ingestions
unprocessed = get_unprocessed()

for ingestion in unprocessed:
    # download the raw article 
    raw = supabase.storage.from_("raw-payloads").download(ingestion["storage_path"])
    # this is the same dict as raw_payload above 
    payload = json.loads(raw)

    # DO PROCESSING ON ARTICLE HERE

    # create event with processed info
    # data is mocked here for this example
    event_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    event = insert_event(
        Event(
            event_id=event_id,
            raw_payload_ref=ingestion["storage_path"],
            source=ingestion["source"],
            event_type="economic_release",
            published_at="2026-03-04",
            region="US",
            asset_classes=["bonds", "equities"],
            content="US inflation rose to 4.2% in March, exceeding expectations of 3.8%.",
            importance_score=0.9,
            entities={"countries": ["US"]},
            topic="inflation",
            sentiment="risk-off",
        )
    )

    mark_processed(ingestion["id"], event_id)
```
